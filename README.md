## 1. Introduction to Python Programming

Get started with the basics of Python, including installation, syntax, and writing your first "Hello, World!" program.

## 2. Data Types in Python

Learn about the various data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

## 3. Indexing and Slicing

Explore how to access and manipulate elements within data structures using indexing and slicing.

## 4. Operations in Data Types

Understand the different operations that can be performed on Python data types, including arithmetic operations, string concatenation, and more.

## 5. Statements, Indentation & Conditionals

Master the use of statements, proper indentation, and conditional statements to control the flow of your Python programs.

## 6. Loops & Iterations

Discover the power of loops and iterations to repeat code execution and automate repetitive tasks.

## 7. Conditional & Infinite Looping

Learn advanced looping techniques, including conditional looping and handling infinite loops.

## 8. Custom Functions in Python

Create and use custom functions to modularize your code and enhance code reusability.

## 9. Advanced Looping Concepts

Dive deeper into advanced looping concepts, including nested loops and loop control statements.

## 10. Object-Oriented Programming in Python
